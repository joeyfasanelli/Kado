## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App not loading**:
   - Check if all files are uploaded
   - Verify `index.html` is in the root directory
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Mobile not working**:
   - Ensure viewport meta tag is present
   - Test on actual device, not just browser dev tools
   - Check touch event handling

3. **PWA not installing**:
   - Verify `manifest.json` is accessible
   - Check HTTPS is enabled
   - Ensure service worker is registered (if using)

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow loading**:
   - CDN resources should load quickly
   - Consider self-hosting if CDN is slow in your region
   - Check network tab for slow requests

2. **Mobile performance**:
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Use Chrome DevTools mobile simulation
   - Check for memory leaks in long sessions
